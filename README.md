Introduction
This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting Diabetic Retinopathy using deep
learning techniques, specifically CNNs, applied to retinal fundus images. By training a deep learning
model on a dataset of labelled retinal images, the system is designed to classify different stages of
DR, ranging from no DR to proliferative DR. This classification not only provides diagnostic
information but also helps gauge the severity of the disease, which is critical for treatment
planning.

Objective
Automate DR Detection: Develop an automated system using deep learning to detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images, reducing the need for manual examination.
Achieve High Accuracy: Build and fine-tune a deep learning model (e.g., CNN) that achieves high accuracy in classifying retinal images into different stages of diabetic retinopathy or detecting DR-positive cases.
Early Detection: Enable early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy to prevent vision loss by accurately identifying early signs of the disease, such as microaneurysms and hemorrhages.

Conclusion
The "Automatic Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Deep Learning" project successfully
demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence in early detection and classification of diabetic
retinopathy stages. By leveraging the ResNet50 architecture, combined with careful data
preprocessing and robust evaluation metrics, the model achieved significant accuracy in classifying
diabetic retinopathy into five distinct categories. This automation offers a promising solution to the
growing need for accessible and rapid diagnostic tools, especially in regions where access to
ophthalmologists may be limited. The projectâ€™s outcomes highlight the effectiveness of deep
learning in medical imaging, proving that AI-driven models can support clinicians by accurately
identifying retinopathy stages and potentially helping to prevent blindness through early
intervention.
